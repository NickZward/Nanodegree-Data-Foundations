### Project 4: Data Visualization Using Tableau

In this project I created three visualizations using Tableau to reveal insights from a data set. I created data visualizations that told a story or highlighted patterns in the data set. My work was a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

The data set I worked with was about flight delays and cacellations. This data came from a Kaggle dataset. It tracked the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015.
