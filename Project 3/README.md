### Project 3: Query a Digital Music Store Database

In this project I analyzed a database that belonged to a digital music store. The database held information regarding the storeâ€™s media, employees, and customers. I used the database to help the store gain an understanding of the types of music that are purchased, where customers live, and how the company might optimize their business practices. Every query writing to gain insights from the database had to contain at least one join and one aggregation. 

I had to use the pulled data and build a visual using Microsoft Excel to make the found insight easier to present. 

After finishing this project I felt comfortable using:
- Various SQL commands to filter a table in many different ways (SELECT, FROM, LIMT, ORDER BY, WHERE, LIKE, IN, NOT, AND, OR, BETWEEN).
- Combining data from different tables using various JOINS (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN and OUTER JOIN).
- Various aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT, CASE, HAVING, DATE).
- Using SQL subqueries and temporary tables.
- Cleaning data using SQL ( LEFT, RIGHT, POSITION, STRPOS, CONCAT, CAST, COALESCE).
