### Project 2: Analyze Survey Data

In this project, I analyzed a real dataset about current Udacity students across a number of programs, so it wasn't perfect. It was a little messy. I had to decide how to analyze the data and then communicate my findings about it. 

In this project, I went through the process of calculating summary statistics and building visual methods of spreadsheet data to find interesting information out about Udacity students. The goal was that I not only could perform an analysis, but also be able to communicate the results in a way that is clear and compelling.

After completing the lessons and the project, I feel comfortable in my ability to:
- Identify different datatypes to determine what analyses are possible.
- Calculate measures of center and spread to describe quantitative data.
- Use a variety of spreadsheet functionality to gain insights from data.
- Build charts and graphs to communicate the results of your analysis.
- Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions.
- Analyze a future dataset using Excel.
