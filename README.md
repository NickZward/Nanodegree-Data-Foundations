Projects for my Udacity Data Foundations Nanodegree

### Project 1: Interpret a Data Visualization

A large part of working with data is being able to interpret data visualizations and explain your insights to others. To get some experience with this, I was given a few Tableau dashboards to explore. I had to find three insights in the visualizations. For each insight, I had to provide a static image that shares what I found. I also had to write a short report explaining each observation and how I found the information to reach my conclusion from the dashboard.

There were two goals for this first project:
- Begin building your data intuition by looking at data dashboards and drawing insights for yourself.
- Glimpse into your future. By the end of this program, you will not only be able to draw conclusions from these dashboards, but you will be able to build dashboards for yourself just like the ones you see here in the first project!

### Project 2: Analyze Survey Data

In this project, I analyzed a real dataset about current Udacity students across a number of programs, so it wasn't perfect. It was a little messy. I had to decide how to analyze the data and then communicate my findings about it. 

In this project, I went through the process of calculating summary statistics and building visual methods of spreadsheet data to find interesting information out about Udacity students. The goal was that I not only could perform an analysis, but also be able to communicate the results in a way that is clear and compelling.

After completing the lessons and the project, I feel comfortable in my ability to:
- Identify different datatypes to determine what analyses are possible.
- Calculate measures of center and spread to describe quantitative data.
- Use a variety of spreadsheet functionality to gain insights from data.
- Build charts and graphs to communicate the results of your analysis.
- Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions.
- Analyze a future dataset using Excel.
