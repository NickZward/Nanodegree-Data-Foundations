### Project 1: Interpret a Data Visualization

A large part of working with data is being able to interpret data visualizations and explain your insights to others. To get some experience with this, I was given a few Tableau dashboards to explore. I had to find three insights in the visualizations. For each insight, I had to provide a static image that shares what I found. I also had to write a short report explaining each observation and how I found the information to reach my conclusion from the dashboard.

There were two goals for this first project:
- Begin building your data intuition by looking at data dashboards and drawing insights for yourself.
- Glimpse into your future. By the end of this program, you will not only be able to draw conclusions from these dashboards, but you will be able to build dashboards for yourself just like the ones you see here in the first project!
